-----README - BLUECRYSTALP2 - SUSYv2 ANALYSIS CODE-----

written by Chris Lucas

This aims to document all of the changes to the SUSYv2 code necessary in order to use on
the bristol HPC 'BlueCrystalp2'.

- Changes to the configure.py file were made to include a bluecrystal option
	NOTE: these will need to be changed once a centrally installed version of the CMS software
	becomes available. The current iteration is based around a user-local install of the CMS
	software and so will need to be changed pre-commit to svn

- framework/python/icf/core.py, mainly with the qsub command. This must be changed at blue
due to a different version of qsub being installed. The main difference is with the format of
the '-t' option. 
"-t", "%d-%d:1"  --->  "-t", "%d-%d"

- the psets containing the directories of the datasets must be changed. If running locally then
the direct path (/gpfs_phys/storm/cms/user/clucas/ICF/automated/...) should be used. 
Alternatively, if direct GRID submission is being used, then the srm-directory should be used 
(check!).

- If direct GRID submission is indeed employed, then the qsub command must be changed to
something similar to glite-wms-job-submit. This will require a restructuring of the job
submission process in order to produce a .jdl job file to be passed with this command.

- In order for the samples to be accessable from blue crystal, all of the datasets must be copied
from /gpfs_phys/storm/... to /gpfs_phys/cms-working/... This is due to issues with access rights
to storm from bluecrystal.
