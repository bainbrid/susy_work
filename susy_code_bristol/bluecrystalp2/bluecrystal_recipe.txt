-----RECIPE - BLUECRYSTALP2 - SUSYv2 ANALYSIS CODE-----

All CMS software required as prerequisites to run the SUSY code is located in
/gpfs_phys/cms-working/software/
The configure.py file has been modified to include this under a new option
for "Bristol - Blue Crystal".
After running the configure.py script and creating setup.sh, source this and
build all necessary directories - framework, hadronic, AlphaTPlots, onelepton
and WPol2 (remember that 'make -j4 -f Debug' will hugely speed this up!).

Changes must be made to framework/python/icf/core.py in order to run on blue-
crystal. These have all been documented in this readme:
https://github.com/lucasc896/susy_work/blob/master/susy_code_bristol/bluecrystalp2/README

Also mentioned in that document are the changes that must be made to the datasets
and where they're stored. In order for access from bluecrystal, the datasets will
need to be copied to /gpfs_phys/cms-working/...
At IC grid tools are used to retrieve the datasets using xrootd, whereas at 
Bristol we will directly access them through gpfs. Therefore the paths will 
need to be changed in the pset files.
