       To create a job is to submit an executable script to  a  batch  server.
       The  batch  server  will  be the default server unless the _-_q option is
       specified.  See discussion of PBS_DEFAULT under  Environment  Variables
       below.   Typically, the script is a shell script which will be executed
       by a command shell such as sh or csh.

       Options on the qqssuubb command allow the specification of attributes which
       affect the behavior of the job.

       The  qsub  command will pass certain environment variables in the _V_a_r_i_-
       _a_b_l_e___L_i_s_t attribute of the job.  These variables will be  available  to
       the  job.  The value for the following variables will be taken from the
       environment of the qsub  command:  HHOOMMEE,  LLAANNGG,  LLOOGGNNAAMMEE,  PPAATTHH,  MMAAIILL,
       SSHHEELLLL,  and  TTZZ.   These values will be assigned to a new name which is
       the current name prefixed with the string "PBS_O_".  For  example,  the
       job  will have access to an environment variable named PPBBSS__OO__HHOOMMEE which
       have the value of the variable HHOOMMEE in the qsub command environment.

       In addition to the above, the following environment variables  will  be
       available to the batch job.

       PPBBSS__OO__HHOOSSTT
              the name of the host upon which the qsub command is running.

       PPBBSS__SSEERRVVEERR
              the hostname of the pbs_server which qsub submits the job to.

       PPBBSS__OO__QQUUEEUUEE
              the name of the original queue to which the job was submitted.

       PPBBSS__OO__WWOORRKKDDIIRR
              the  absolute  path of the current working directory of the qsub
              command.

       PPBBSS__AARRRRAAYYIIDD
              each member of a job array is assigned a unique identifier  (see
              -t)

       PPBBSS__EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT
              set  to  PPBBSS__BBAATTCCHH  to  indicate  the  job is a batch job, or to
              PPBBSS__IINNTTEERRAACCTTIIVVEE to indicate the job is a  PBS  interactive  job,
              see -I option.

       PPBBSS__JJOOBBIIDD
              the job identifier assigned to the job by the batch system.

       PPBBSS__JJOOBBNNAAMMEE
              the job name supplied by the user.

       PPBBSS__NNOODDEEFFIILLEE
              the  name  of the file contain the list of nodes assigned to the
              job (for parallel and cluster systems).

       PPBBSS__QQUUEEUUEE
              the name of the queue from which the job is executed.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       -a date_time
               Declares the time after which the job is  eligible  for  execu-
               tion.

               The      _d_a_t_e___t_i_m_e     argument     is     in     the     form:
               [[[[[[[[CCCC]]YYYY]]MMMM]]DDDD]]hhhhmmmm[[..SSSS]]

               Where CC is the first two digits of the year (the century),  YY
               is  the second two digits of the year, MM is the two digits for
               the month, DD is the day of the month, hh is the  hour,  mm  is
               the minute, and the optional SS is the seconds.

               If the month, MMMM, is not specified, it will default to the cur-
               rent month if the specified day DDDD, is in the  future.   Other-
               wise,  the  month  will be set to next month.  Likewise, if the
               day, DDDD, is not specified, it will default to today if the time
               hhhhmmmm  is  in  the  future.   Otherwise,  the day will be set to
               tomorrow.  For example, if you submit a job at 11:15am  with  a
               time  of  --aa  11111100,  the job will be eligible to run at 11:10am
               tomorrow.

       -A account_string
               Defines the  account  string  associated  with  the  job.   The
               _a_c_c_o_u_n_t___s_t_r_i_n_g  is  an  undefined  string  of characters and is
               interpreted by the server which executes the job.  See  section
               2.7.1 of the PBS ERS.

       -b seconds
               Defines  the maximum number of seconds qsub will block attempt-
               ing to contact pbs_server.  If pbs_server is  down,  or  for  a
               variety  of communication failures, qsub will continually retry
               connecting to pbs_server for job submission.  This value  over-
               rides  the CCLLIIEENNTTRREETTRRYY parameter in ttoorrqquuee..ccffgg..  This is a non-
               portable TORQUE extension.  Portability-minded  users  can  use
               the  PPBBSS__CCLLIIEENNTTRREETTRRYY  environmental variable.  A negative value
               is interpreted as infinity.  The default is 0.

       -c interval
               Defines the interval at which the job will be checkpointed.  If
               the job executes upon a host which does not support checkpoint,
               this option will be ignored.

               The _i_n_t_e_r_v_a_l argument is specified as:

               n  No checkpointing is to be performed.

               s  Checkpointing is to be performed only when the  server  exe-
                  cuting the job is shutdown.

               c  Checkpointing is to be performed at the default minimum time
                  for the server executing the job.

               c=minutes
                  Checkpointing is to be performed at an interval of  _m_i_n_u_t_e_s,
                  which  is  the integer number of minutes of CPU time used by
                  the job.  This value must be greater than zero.

       -C directive_prefix
               Defines the prefix that declares a directive to the  qsub  com-
               mand  within  the  script  file.   See  the paragraph on script
               directives in the Extended Description section.

               If the _-_C option is presented with a _d_i_r_e_c_t_i_v_e___p_r_e_f_i_x  argument
               that is the null string, qsub will not scan the script file for
               directives.

       -d path Defines the working directory path to be used for the job.   If
               the  _-_d  option is not specified, the default working directory
               is the home directory.  This option sets the environment  vari-
               able PBS_O_INITDIR.

       -D path Defines the root directory to be used for the job.  This option
               sets the environment variable PBS_O_ROOTDIR.

       -e path Defines the path to be used for the standard  error  stream  of
               the batch job.  The _p_a_t_h argument is of the form:
                   [[hhoossttnnaammee::]]ppaatthh__nnaammee
               where  hhoossttnnaammee is the name of a host to which the file will be
               returned and ppaatthh__nnaammee is the path name on  that  host  in  the
               syntax  recognized  by POSIX.  The argument will be interpreted
               as follows:

               ppaatthh__nnaammee
                      Where path_name is not an absolute path name,  then  the
                      qsub  command  will expand the path name relative to the
                      current working directory of the command.   The  command
                      will  supply  the name of the host upon which it is exe-
                      cuting for the _h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e component.

               hhoossttnnaammee::ppaatthh__nnaammee
                      Where path_name is not an absolute path name,  then  the
                      qsub  command  will not expand the path name relative to
                      the current working directory of the command.  On deliv-
                      ery  of  the  standard  error,  the  path  name  will be
                      expanded relative to the user's home  directory  on  the
                      hhoossttnnaammee system.

               ppaatthh__nnaammee
                      Where  path_name  specifies  an absolute path name, then
                      the qsub will supply the name of the host on which it is
                      executing for the _h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e.

               hhoossttnnaammee::ppaatthh__nnaammee
                      Where  path_name  specifies  an  absolute path name, the
                      path will be used as specified.

               If the _-_e option is not specified, the default  file  name  for
               the  standard  error stream will be used.  The default name has
               the following form:
                   jjoobb__nnaammee..eesseeqquueennccee__nnuummbbeerr
               where jjoobb__nnaammee is the name of  the  job,  see  _-_N  option,  and
               sseeqquueennccee__nnuummbbeerr is the job number assigned when the job is sub-
               mitted.

       -h      Specifies that a user hold be applied to the job at  submission
               time.

       -I      Declares  that  the  job is to be run "interactively".  The job
               will be queued and scheduled as any PBS  batch  job,  but  when
               executed,  the standard input, output, and error streams of the
               job are connected through qsub to the terminal session in which
               qsub is running.  Interactive jobs are forced to not rerunable.
               See the "Extended Description" paragraph for addition  informa-
               tion of interactive jobs.

       -j join Declares if the standard error stream of the job will be merged
               with the standard output stream of the job.

               An option argument value of ooee directs  that  the  two  streams
               will  be  merged,  intermixed,  as  standard output.  An option
               argument value of eeoo directs  that  the  two  streams  will  be
               merged, intermixed, as standard error.

               If  the  _j_o_i_n argument is nn or the option is not specified, the
               two streams will be two separate files.

       -k keep Defines which (if either) of standard output or standard  error
               will  be  retained on the execution host.  If set for a stream,
               this option overrides the path name for that  stream.   If  not
               set, neither stream is retained on the execution host.

               The  argument  is  either  the single letter "e" or "o", or the
               letters "e" and "o" combined in either order.  Or the  argument
               is the letter "n".

               e  The  standard  error  stream is to retained on the execution
                  host.  The  stream will be placed in the home  directory  of
                  the  user  under  whose  user id the job executed.  The file
                  name will be the default file name given  by:  jjoobb__nnaammee..eessee--
                  qquueennccee where jjoobb__nnaammee is the name specified for the job, and
                  sseeqquueennccee is the sequence number component of the job identi-
                  fier.

               o  The  standard  output stream is to retained on the execution
                  host.  The  stream will be placed in the home  directory  of
                  the  user  under  whose  user id the job executed.  The file
                  name will be the default file name given  by:  jjoobb__nnaammee..oossee--
                  qquueennccee where jjoobb__nnaammee is the name specified for the job, and
                  sseeqquueennccee is the sequence number component of the job identi-
                  fier.

               eo Both  the standard output and standard error streams will be
                  retained.

               oe Both the standard output and standard error streams will  be
                  retained.

               n  Neither stream is retained.

       -l resource_list
               Defines  the  resources that are required by the job and estab-
               lishes a limit to the amount of resource that can be  consumed.
               If  not  set  for  a  generally available resource, such as CPU
               time, the limit is infinite.  The _r_e_s_o_u_r_c_e___l_i_s_t argument is  of
               the form:
                   rreessoouurrccee__nnaammee[[==[[vvaalluuee]]]][[,,rreessoouurrccee__nnaammee[[==[[vvaalluuee]]]],,......]]

       -m mail_options
               Defines  the set of conditions under which the execution server
               will send a mail message about the job.  The _m_a_i_l___o_p_t_i_o_n_s argu-
               ment  is a string which consists of either the single character
               "nn", or one or more of the characters "aa", "bb", and "ee".

               If the character "nn" is specified, no mail will be sent.

               For the letters "aa", "bb", and "ee":

               a  mail is sent when the job is aborted by the batch system.

               b  mail is sent when the job begins execution.

               e  mail is sent when the job terminates.

               If the _-_m option is not specified, mail will be sent if the job
               is aborted.

       -M user_list
               Declares  the  list of users to whom mail is sent by the execu-
               tion server when it sends mail about the job.

               The _u_s_e_r___l_i_s_t argument is of the form:
                   uusseerr[[@@hhoosstt]][[,,uusseerr[[@@hhoosstt]],,......]]
               If unset, the list defaults to the submitting user at the  qsub
               host, i.e. the job owner.

       -N name Declares  a  name for the job.  The name specified may be up to
               and including 15 characters in  length.   It  must  consist  of
               printable,  non white space characters with the first character
               alphabetic.

               If the _-_N option is not specified, the job  name  will  be  the
               base name of the job script file specified on the command line.
               If no script file name was specified and the  script  was  read
               from  the  standard  input,  then  the  job name will be set to
               SSTTDDIINN.

       -o path Defines the path to be used for the standard output  stream  of
               the batch job.  The _p_a_t_h argument is of the form:
                   [[hhoossttnnaammee::]]ppaatthh__nnaammee
               where  hhoossttnnaammee is the name of a host to which the file will be
               returned and ppaatthh__nnaammee is the path name on  that  host  in  the
               syntax  recognized  by POSIX.  The argument will be interpreted
               as follows:

               ppaatthh__nnaammee
                      Where path_name is not an absolute path name,  then  the
                      qsub  command  will expand the path name relative to the
                      current working directory of the command.   The  command
                      will  supply  the name of the host upon which it is exe-
                      cuting for the _h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e component.

               hhoossttnnaammee::ppaatthh__nnaammee
                      Where path_name is not an absolute path name,  then  the
                      qsub  command  will not expand the path name relative to
                      the current working directory of the command.  On deliv-
                      ery  of  the  standard  output,  the  path  name will be
                      expanded relative to the user's home  directory  on  the
                      hhoossttnnaammee system.

               ppaatthh__nnaammee
                      Where  path_name  specifies  an absolute path name, then
                      the qsub will supply the name of the host on which it is
                      executing for the _h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e.

               hhoossttnnaammee::ppaatthh__nnaammee
                      Where  path_name  specifies  an  absolute path name, the
                      path will be used as specified.

               If the _-_o option is not specified, the default  file  name  for
               the  standard output stream will be used.  The default name has
               the following form:
                   jjoobb__nnaammee..oosseeqquueennccee__nnuummbbeerr
               where jjoobb__nnaammee is the name of  the  job,  see  _-_N  option,  and
               sseeqquueennccee__nnuummbbeerr is the job number assigned when the job is sub-
               mitted.

       -p priority
               Defines the priority of the job.  The _p_r_i_o_r_i_t_y argument must be
               a integer between -1024 and +1023 inclusive.  The default is no
               priority which is equivalent to a priority of zero.

       -q destination
               Defines the destination of the job.  The  _d_e_s_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n  names  a
               queue, a server, or a queue at a server.

               The  qsub  command will submit the script to the server defined
               by the _d_e_s_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n argument.  If the destination is  a  _r_o_u_t_i_n_g
               _q_u_e_u_e_,  the  job  may be routed by the server to a new destina-
               tion.

               If the _-_q option is not specified, the qsub command will submit
               the  script  to  the default server.  See PBS_DEFAULT under the
               Environment Variables section on this man page and the PBS  ERS
               section 2.7.4, "Default Server".

               If  the  _-_q  option is specified, it is in one of the following
               three forms:
                   qquueeuuee
                   @@sseerrvveerr
                   qquueeuuee@@sseerrvveerr

               If the _d_e_s_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n argument names a queue and does not  name  a
               server,  the  job  will  be submitted to the named queue at the
               default server.

               If the _d_e_s_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n argument names a server and does not name  a
               queue,  the  job  will be submitted to the default queue at the
               named server.

               If the _d_e_s_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n argument names both a queue  and  a  server,
               the  job  will  be  submitted  to  the named queue at the named
               server.

       -r y|n  Declares whether the job is rerunable.  See the qqrreerruunn command.
               The option argument is a single character, either yy or nn.

               If  the argument is "yy", the job is rerunable.  If the argument
               is "nn", the job is not rerunable.  The default  value  is  'y',
               rerunable.

       -S path_list
               Declares the shell that interprets the job script.

               The option argument _p_a_t_h___l_i_s_t is in the form:
                   ppaatthh[[@@hhoosstt]][[,,ppaatthh[[@@hhoosstt]],,......]]
               Only  one  path  may be specified for any host named.  Only one
               path may be specified without the corresponding host name.  The
               path  selected  will be the one with the host name that matched
               the name of the execution host.  If no matching host is  found,
               then  the  path  specified  without a host will be selected, if
               present.

               If the _-_S option is not specified, the option argument  is  the
               null  string,  or  no entry from the _p_a_t_h___l_i_s_t is selected, the
               execution will use the user's  login  shell  on  the  execution
               host.

       -t array_request
               Specifies  the task ids of a job array.  Single task arrays are
               allowed.

               The _a_r_r_a_y___r_e_q_u_e_s_t argument is an integer id or a range of inte-
               gers.  Multiple  ids  or  id  ranges can be combined in a comma
               delimted list. Examples : -t 1-100 or -t 1,10,50-100

       -u user_list
               Defines the user name under which the job is to run on the exe-
               cution system.

               The _u_s_e_r___l_i_s_t argument is of the form:
                   uusseerr[[@@hhoosstt]][[,,uusseerr[[@@hhoosstt]],,......]]
               Only  one  user name may be given per specified host.  Only one
               of the uusseerr specifications may be supplied without  the  corre-
               sponding hhoosstt specification.  That user name will used for exe-
               cution on any host not named in the argument list.   If  unset,
               the user list defaults to the user who is running qsub.

       -v variable_list
               Expands  the list of environment variables that are exported to
               the job.

               In addition to the variables  described  in  the  "Description"
               section  above,  _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e___l_i_s_t names environment variables from
               the qsub command environment which are made  available  to  the
               job  when  it executes.  The _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e___l_i_s_t is a comma separated
               list of strings of the form vvaarriiaabbllee or vvaarriiaabbllee==vvaalluuee.   These
               variables and their values are passed to the job.

       -V      Declares  that  all environment variables in the qsub command's
               environment are to be exported to the batch job.

       -W additional_attributes
               The -W option allows for the specification  of  additional  job
               attributes.  The general syntax of the -W is in the form:
                   --WW aattttrr__nnaammee==aattttrr__vvaalluuee[[,,aattttrr__nnaammee==aattttrr__vvaalluuee......]]
               Note  if white space occurs anywhere within the option argument
               string or the equal sign, "=", occurs within an _a_t_t_r_i_b_u_t_e___v_a_l_u_e
               string,  then the string must be enclosed with either single or
               double quote marks.

               PBS currently supports the following attributes within  the  -W
               option.

               ddeeppeenndd==ddeeppeennddeennccyy__lliisstt
               Defines the dependency between this and other jobs.  The _d_e_p_e_n_-
               _d_e_n_c_y___l_i_s_t is in the form:
               ttyyppee[[::aarrgguummeenntt[[::aarrgguummeenntt......]][[,,ttyyppee::aarrgguummeenntt......]].
               The _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t is either a numeric count or a PBS job id  accord-
               ing  to _t_y_p_e _.  If argument is a count, it must be greater than
               0.  If it is a job id and  not  fully  specified  in  the  form
               sseeqq__nnuummbbeerr..sseerrvveerr..nnaammee,  it  will  be expanded according to the
               default server rules which apply to job IDs on  most  commands.
               If  _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t  is  null  (the preceding colon need not be speci-
               fied), the dependency of  the  corresponding  type  is  cleared
               (unset).

                   ssyynnccccoouunntt::ccoouunntt
                       This  job  is the first in a set of jobs to be executed
                       at the same time.  _C_o_u_n_t is the  number  of  additional
                       jobs in the set.

                   ssyynnccwwiitthh::jjoobbiidd
                       This job is an additional member of a set of jobs to be
                       executed at the same time.  In the above and  following
                       dependency  types,  _j_o_b_i_d  is the job identifier of the
                       first job in the set.

                   aafftteerr::jjoobbiidd[[::jjoobbiidd......]]
                       This job may be scheduled for execution  at  any  point
                       after jobs _j_o_b_i_d have started execution.

                       dependencies  on  other jobs have been satisfied.  This
                       form is used in conjunction  with  one  of  the  bbeeffoorree
                       forms, see below.

                       begin.

                       If  any  of  the bbeeffoorree forms are used, the jobs refer-

                       dency type of oonn.

                       If  any  of  the bbeeffoorree forms are used, the jobs refer-
                       enced by jjoobbiidd must have the  same  owner  as  the  job
                       being submitted.  Otherwise, the dependency is ignored.

                   Error processing of the existence, state, or  condition  of
                   the job on which the newly submitted job is a deferred ser-
                   vice, i.e. the check is performed after the job is  queued.
                   If an error is detected, the new job will be deleted by the
                   server.  Mail will be sent to the job submitter stating the
                   error.

               Defines the group name under which the job is  to  run  on  the
               execution system.  The _g___l_i_s_t argument is of the form:
               ggrroouupp[[@@hhoosstt]][[,,ggrroouupp[[@@hhoosstt]],,......]]
               Only  one group name may be given per specified host.  Only one
               of the ggrroouupp specifications may be supplied without the  corre-
               sponding  hhoosstt  specification.   That  group name will used for
               execution on any host not named in the argument list.   If  not
               set,  the  _g_r_o_u_p___l_i_s_t defaults to the primary group of the user

               Specifies which files are staged (copied) in before  job  start
               or staged out after the job completes execution.  On completion
               of the job, all staged-in and staged-out files are removed from
               the execution system.  The _f_i_l_e___l_i_s_t is in the form
               llooccaall__ffiillee@@hhoossttnnaammee::rreemmoottee__ffiillee[[,,......]]
               regardless  of  the direction of the copy.  The name llooccaall__ffiillee
               is the name of the file on the system where the  job  executed.
               It may be an absolute path or relative to the home directory of
               the user.  The name rreemmoottee__ffiillee is the destination name on  the
               host  specified by hhoossttnnaammee.  The name may be absolute or rela-
               tive to the user's home directory on the destination host.  The
               use of wildcards in the file name is not recommended.  The file
               names map to a remote copy program (rcp) call on the  execution
               system in the follow manner:
               For stagein:   rcp hostname:remote_file local_file
               For stageout:  rcp local_file hostname:remote_file

               If  TORQUE  has  been compiled with wordexp support, then vari-
               ables can be used  in  the  specified  paths.   Currently  only
               $PBS_JOBID, $HOME, and $TMPDIR are supported for stagein.

               uummaasskk==XXXXXX
               Sets  umask  used  to  create  stdout and stderr spool files in
               pbs_mom spool directory

       -X      Enables X11 forwarding.  The DISPLAY environment variable  must
               be set.

       -z      Directs  that  the qsub command is not to write the job identi-
               fier assigned to the job to the command's standard output.


OOPPEERRAANNDDSS
       The qsub command accepts a _s_c_r_i_p_t operand  that  is  the  path  to  the
       script  of the job.  If the path is relative, it will be expanded rela-
       tive to the working directory of the qsub command.

       If the _s_c_r_i_p_t operand is not provided or  the  operand  is  the  single
       character  "-",  the qsub command reads the script from standard input.
       When the script is being read from Standard Input, qsub will  copy  the
       file to a temporary file.  This temporary file is passed to the library
       interface routine pbs_submit.  The temporary file is  removed  by  qsub
       after  pbs_submit  returns  or upon the receipt of a signal which would
       cause qsub to terminate.

SSTTAANNDDAARRDD IINNPPUUTT
       The qsub command reads the script for the job from  standard  input  if
       the _s_c_r_i_p_t operand is missing or is the single character "-".

IINNPPUUTT FFIILLEESS
       The _s_c_r_i_p_t file is read by the qsub command.  Qsub acts upon any direc-
       tives found in the script.

       When the job is created, a copy of the script file  is  made  and  that
       copy cannot be modified.

       Unless  the  _-_z  option  is set, the job identifier assigned to the job
       will be written to standard output if the job is successfully  created.

SSTTAANNDDAARRDD EERRRROORR
       The  qsub command will write a diagnostic message to standard error for
       each error occurrence.

EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT VVAARRIIAABBLLEESS
       The values of some or all of the variables in the qsub command's  envi-
       ronment are exported with the job, see the -v and -V options.

       The  environment  variable  PPBBSS__DDEEFFAAUULLTT defines the name of the default
       server.   Typically, it corresponds to the system name of the  host  on
       which the server is running.  If PBS_DEFAULT is not set, the default is
       defined by an administrator established file.

       The environment variable PPBBSS__DDPPRREEFFIIXX determines the prefix string which
       identifies directives in the script.

       The  environment variable PPBBSS__CCLLIIEENNTTRREETTRRYY defines the maximum number of
       seconds qsub will block.  See the -b option above.  Despite  the  name,
       currently qsub is the only client that supports this option.

       Script Processing:

       A  job  script  may  consist of PBS directives, comments and executable
       statements.   A  PBS  directive  provides  a  way  of  specifying   job
       attributes in addition to the command line options.  For example:
              ::
              ##PPBBSS --NN JJoobb__nnaammee
              ##PPBBSS --ll wwaallllttiimmee==1100::3300,,mmeemm==332200kkbb
              ##PPBBSS --mm bbee
              ##
              sstteepp11 aarrgg11 aarrgg22
              sstteepp22 aarrgg33 aarrgg44


       The qsub command scans the lines of the script file for directives.  An
       initial line in the script that begins with the characters "#!" or  the
       character  ":"  will  be  ignored and scanning will start with the next
       line.  Scanning will continue until the first executable line, that  is
       a  line that is not blank, not a directive line, nor a line whose first
       non white space character is "#".  If directives  occur  on  subsequent
       lines, they will be ignored.

       A  line  in the script file will be processed as a directive to qsub if
       and only if the string of characters starting with the first non  white
       space  character  on  the  line and of the same length as the directive
       prefix matches the directive prefix.

       The remainder of the directive line consists of the options to qsub  in
       the same syntax as they appear on the command line.  The option charac-
       ter is to be preceded with the "-" character.

       If an option is present in both a directive and on  the  command  line,
       that option and its argument, if any, will be ignored in the directive.
       The command line takes precedence.

       If an option is present in a directive and not  on  the  command  line,
       that  option  and  its argument, if any, will be processed as if it had
       occurred on the command line.

       The directive prefix string will be determined in order  of  preference
       from:

           The  value  of the _-_C option argument if the option is specified on
           the command line.

           The value of the environment variable PPBBSS__DDPPRREEFFIIXX if it is defined.

           The four character string ##PPBBSS.

       If the _-_C option is found in a directive in the script file, it will be
       ignored.

       User Authorization:

       When the user submits a job from a system other than the one  on  which
       the  PBS  Server is running, the name under which the job is to be exe-
       cuted is selected according to the rules listed under  the  -u  option.
       The user submitting the job must be authorized to run the job under the
       execution user name.  This authorization is provided if

              (1)  The host on which qsub is run is trusted by  the  execution
                   host (see /etc/hosts.equiv),

              (2)  The  execution  user has an .rhosts file naming the submit-
                   ting user on the submitting host.

       C-Shell .logout File:

       The following warning applies for users of the c-shell,  csh.   If  the
       job  is  executed  under  the csh and a _._l_o_g_o_u_t file exists in the home
       directory in which the job executes, the exit status of the job is that
       of  the .logout script, not the job script.  This may impact any inter-
       job dependencies.  To preserve the job exit status, either  remove  the
       .logout  file  or  place  the  following  line as the first line in the
       .logout file
          sseett EEXXIITTVVAALL == $$ssttaattuuss
       and the following line as the last executable line in .logout
          eexxiitt $$EEXXIITTVVAALL

       Interactive Jobs:

       If the _-_I option is specified on the command line or in a script direc-
       tive,  or  if  the "interactive" job attribute declared true via the -W
       option, --WW iinntteerraaccttiivvee==ttrruuee, either on the command line or in a  script
       directive, the job is an interactive job.  The script will be processed
       for directives, but will not be included with the job.   When  the  job
       begins  execution, all input to the job is from the terminal session in
       which qsub is running.

       When an interactive job is submitted, the qsub command will not  termi-
       nate when the job is submitted.  Qsub will remain running until the job
       terminates, is aborted, or the user interrupts qsub with an SIGINT (the
       control-C  key).   If  qsub  is interrupted prior to job start, it will
       query if the user wishes to exit.  If the  user  response  "yes",  qsub
       exits and the job is aborted.

       One the interactive job has started execution, input to and output from
       the job pass through qsub.  Keyboard generated interrupts are passed to
       the  job.   Lines entered that begin with the tilde ('~') character and
       contain special sequences are escaped by qsub.  The  recognized  escape
       sequences are:

              ~.     Qsub  terminates execution.  The batch job is also termi-
                     nated.

              ~susp  Suspend the qsub program if running under  the  C  shell.
                     "susp" is the suspend character, usually CNTL-Z.

              ~asusp Suspend  the  input  half  of qsub (terminal to job), but
                     allow output to continue to  be  displayed.   Only  works
                     under  the  C  shell.   "asusp"  is the auxiliary suspend
                     character, usually CNTL-Y.

       Upon successful processing, the qsub exit status will  be  a  value  of
       zero.

       If  the qsub command fails, the command exits with a value greater than
       zero.
