\abstract{ An inclusive search for supersymmetric processes that
produce final states with jets and missing transverse energy is
performed in pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s} =
8\TeV$. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of
18.3\fbinv collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC. In this search,
a dimensionless kinematic variable, \alphat, is used to discriminate
between events with genuine and misreconstructed missing transverse
energy. The search is based on an examination of the number of
reconstructed jets per event, the scalar sum of transverse energies of
these jets, and the number of these jets identified as originating
from bottom quarks. The results are interpreted with various
simplified models, with a special emphasis on models with a (near)
degenerate particle mass spectrum.}
