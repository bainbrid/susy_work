\subsubsection{Search for supersymmetry in all-hadronic events with $\alpha_T$}

This search is one representative example of a pure hadronic search, vetoing
leptons and requiring high jet multiplicity, \MET, and \HT. QCD is the 
most important background in this region of the phase space. In order to suppress
QCD events, this analysis uses a kinematical variable called $\alphat_T$. For events
with exactly two jets, $\alpha_T$, is defined as the transverse energy of the subleading jet
over the transverse mass of the dijet system. For events with two or more jets,
two pseudo-jets are created by adding the transverse energy of the components and selecting
the configuration that minimizes the energy between the two. $\alpha_T$ is equal
to $0.5$ in balanced QCD events and less than $0.5$ in QCD events with mismeasurements,
providing a good discriminator. To estimate the remaining significant backgrounds: W+jets,
top-pair production, single top and Z to neutrinos, different data control regions are used.

The signal region is defined by \HT$>$275 GeV and $\alpha_T >$0.55, which is divided
into eight bins in HT: two bins of width 50 GeV in the range 275$<$\HT$<$375 GeV, five
bins of width 100 GeV in the range 375$<$\HT$<$875 GeV, and a final open bin, 
\HT$>$ 875 GeV. 

A cross trigger based on the quantities \HT and $\alpha_T$, is used with various
thresholds to record the event sample for the hadronic signal region. A prescaled
\HT trigger, labelled henceforth as \HT, is used with various thresholds to record
events for the hadronic control region. The \HT thresholds of the \HT and $\HT$-$\alpha_T$
crosstriggers are chosen to match where possible, with thresholds of 250,
300, 350, 400 and 450GeV. The $\alpha_T$ thresholds of the $\HT$-$\alpha_T$ trigger are
tuned according to the threshold on the \HT leg in order to fully suppress QCD
multi-jet events (whilst simultaneously satisfying other criteria, such as sensitivity
to trigger rates). 

\FIXME{Technical info on the trigger}

To ensure that the \HT leg of the $\HT$-$\alpha_T$ cross trigger and the \HT prescaled trigger
is efficient with respect to the final event selection, the lower bounds of the offline
HT bins are offset by 25GeV with respect to the online thresholds. Fig. \ref{fig:alphaT} shows
the turn on curves of the \HT and $\alpha_T$ legs with respect to the offline selection.

Efficiencies for the $\HT$-$\alpha_T$ triggers were calculated using an orthogonal dataset
based on single muons, by requiring a matching to a single muon isolated trigger. Exactly 1
isolated muon that is well separated from all jets is required to "tag" the event. This muon
is simply not considered in the calculations of \HT, MHT, DeltaHT, $\alpha_T$. Hence we fake \MET
by ignoring the muon. The assumption for the \HT triggers is that their efficiency is not
sensitive to whether there is genuine \MET in the event or not. The results are shown in table \ref{tab:alphaT}.
